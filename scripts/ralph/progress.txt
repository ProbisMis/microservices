## Codebase Patterns
- Follow `events-common` pattern for shared modules: parent ref, skip spring-boot-maven-plugin, minimal dependencies
- Use `com.demo.programming` as base package for services
- Use `org.programming.microservices` as groupId for modules
---

## 2026-01-24 14:22 - US-001
- Created exceptions-common/pom.xml following events-common pattern
- Files changed: exceptions-common/pom.xml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Shared modules must have `<skip>true</skip>` in spring-boot-maven-plugin config to prevent repackaging as executable JAR
  - Module won't be found by Maven `-pl` flag until added to parent pom.xml modules list
  - spring-web dependency is needed for HttpStatus enum

## 2026-01-24 14:23 - US-002
- Created BaseException abstract class extending RuntimeException
- Files changed: exceptions-common/src/main/java/com/demo/programming/exceptions/base/BaseException.java
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `protected` constructor in abstract exception classes so subclasses can call super()
  - Keep fields `final` for immutability (errorCode, httpStatus, resourceName)
  - Follow events-common package pattern: `com.demo.programming.exceptions.base`
